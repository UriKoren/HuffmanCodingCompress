# comprassor with adaptive huffman alg 

This is a project I did in the first year of the degree together with another member of the course called data compression.



## In the project we implemented:

 - A code compression algorithm called Hoffman adapts end to end.
 - Implementation of a stack data structure specifically for the algorithm.
 - Work with a basic graphical interface.
 - Minimum use of prepared libraries (constraint of the course).
 - Everything is in java language
